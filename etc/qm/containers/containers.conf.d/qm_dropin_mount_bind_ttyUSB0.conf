# USB (Universal Serial Bus) can be used in two main modes: as a standard USB
# device or for serial communication.
#
# 1. USB as a Standard Device
#    -------------------------
#    Most USB devices (e.g., flash drives, keyboards, mice) communicate using
#    the USB protocol. These devices use their own drivers and are typically
#    represented by device files such as /dev/sda for storage devices, or
#    /dev/input/ for input devices. Standard USB devices offer high data
#    transfer rates and advanced features like plug-and-play.
#
# 2. USB for Serial Communication
#    -----------------------------
#    USB can also be used to emulate traditional serial communication (e.g., RS-232).
#    This is common when using USB-to-serial adapters or devices like OBDII
#    (On-Board Diagnostics) interfaces, which convert vehicle diagnostic information
#    from the OBDII port to serial, then to USB, allowing the computer to read the data.
#    In this case, Linux creates device files like /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1,
#    which represent virtual serial ports. These ports allow software to interact
#    with the OBDII device as if it were using a classic serial connection.
#
#    Please NOTE
#    ------------
#    You can find ready-made ELM327 OBD2 (Serial) to USB cables available for
#    purchase, so thereâ€™s no need to build one from scratch unless you really want to.
#    Just make sure that the cable is compatible with your vehicle's manufacturer.
