# Drop-in configuration for Podman to mount bind /dev/input from host to container
#
# Input Device Nodes
# ========================
# The files inside /dev/input are typically character device nodes that
# correspond to input hardware such:
#
# - Keyboards
# - Mice
# - Touchpads
# - Joysticks
# - Multimedia keys
# - Device files like /dev/input/event0, /dev/input/event1, etc., represent
#   different input events from connected devices.
#
# Event Interface
# ==================
# The Linux kernel uses an event-based input system where all user-space
# programs interact with devices via event nodes (/dev/input/event*).
# Each input device (keyboard, mouse, etc.) is associated with an event
# node that captures raw input events, such as key presses, mouse movs, etc.
#
# Programs or services can read input events by opening these device nodes
# and processing the input in real-time.
#
# Types of Devices in /dev/input
# ================================
# /dev/input/mice: All mice input, providing a unified interface
# for all attached mice.
#
# /dev/input/js0, /dev/input/js1: Joystick devices that represent
# individual game controllers.
#
# /dev/input/eventX: Event files where X is a number corresponding to
# each input device's unique event file.
#
# /dev/input/by-id/: Symbolic links to input devices based on their
# unique hardware ID.
#
# /dev/input/by-path/: Symbolic links based on the physical path the
# input device is connected to (useful for distinguishing between
# identical devices connected to different ports).
