Title:
    Validate that the QM directories on the host are not accessible inside the QM partition.

Description:
    The qm package is not installed in the QM partition (its only on the host). So check that you cannot access its directories.

Input:
    This test set executes the following commands respectively:
        `podman exec qm test -d /etc/qm`
        `podman exec qm test -d /usr/lib/qm`
        `podman exec qm test -d /usr/share/qm`

Expected Result:
    out: [ INFO  ] PASS: check_etc_qm_not_accessible: As expected, /etc/qm is not accessible in the QM partition.
    out: [ INFO  ] PASS: check_usr_lib_qm_not_accessible: As expected, /usr/lib/qm is not accessible in the QM partition.
    out: [ INFO  ] PASS: check_usr_share_qm_not_accessible: As expected, /usr/share/qm is not accessible in the QM partition.
