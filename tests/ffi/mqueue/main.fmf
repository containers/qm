summary: Test message queue limit enforcement in QM container and host isolation
description: |
    This test verifies that the fs.mqueue.queues_max=4 sysctl setting is properly
    applied in the QM container and that the limit is enforced when creating message queues
    while the host can create more queues.

    The test will:
    1. Create HOST_QUEUE_COUNT message queues on the host (before container test)
    2. Verify QM container has fs.mqueue.queues_max=4 and can create exactly 4 queues
    3. Create HOST_QUEUE_COUNT more message queues on the host (after container limit reached)
    4. Demonstrate that host can create 2*HOST_QUEUE_COUNT total queues despite container limits

    Expected results:
        - Host message queues work independently before and after container test
        - QM container sysctl fs.mqueue.queues_max returns 4
        - QM container can create exactly 4 message queues then hits limit
        - Host isolation: container limits don't affect host queue creation ability
